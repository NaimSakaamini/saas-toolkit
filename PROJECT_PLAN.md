# Naim SaaS Toolkit - Project Plan

This document outlines the development plan for the Naim SaaS Toolkit, a comprehensive solution for building SaaS applications with Firebase.

## Project Overview

The Naim SaaS Toolkit is a Next.js-based framework that provides all the essential components and services needed to build a SaaS application. It leverages the authentication and organization management functionality from the Firebase Auth Wrapper package but adapts it for a more comprehensive SaaS solution.
